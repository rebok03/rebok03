The William Townsend & Sons collection includes five volumes covering almost a century of work (1830-1910). Volume 1 is a private trade ledger, offering financial information regarding transactions for sales, bills, wages, commissions, insurance, etc. Volume 2 is a prices book, particularly interesting for its detailed samples and prices of paper. Volume 3 is labelled a "works manual and business guide." Volume 4 is described as a "library catalogue" and lists books in the Townsend firm library. Volume 5 is labelled "address book" and contains names of printers, papermakers, ink makers, and such. All volumes are recently digitized and publicly available through RIT Libraries' Digital Collections. 

Our project will use Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines to capture the structural, renditional, and conceptual features of the text. The digital edition will feature a searchable database of people, places, and dates illuminating such key topics as the Townsend firmâ€™s social networks, information on the men, women and apprentices who worked for the firm between 1830 and 1910, and the web of economic partners with whom the firm did business.
